                <p>One class I took in College was called Game Architecture. Throughout this class,
                    slowly created our own Game Engine.
                    <br><br>
                    I started off by learning how to display an image to the screen. From there, I
                    moved that code into a Sprite class. After that, Players and Enemies both need sprites,
                    so I made classes for them as well as any other needed information. Over time, I slowly
                    built up many features like:
                </p>
                <ul style="font-size: 1rem;">
                    <li>Collision Detection</li>
                    <li>Animations with a Sprite Sheet</li>
                    <li>Music and Sound</li>
                    <li>Creating and Listening for Game Events</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>
                    My final project for this class was to create a game. But the catch was,
                    I had to swap out the existing graphics library for a different one. In
                    theory, If I have build up my engine correctly, this should be a simple swap.
                    For the most part, swapping over from Allegro to SFML was easy. I spent quite
                    a bit of time in the documentation reading about what information SFML needed to
                    draw sprites on the screen.
